# Godomon 

(Because pissing off Nintendo never works out well for anyone.) 

An attempt at a recreation of a certain beloved game (yellow version). 

I made a fork of the original project because I deeply love this game. hopefully I can do something meaningful to add to it. 

It's quite barebones at the moment. The entire overworld map is complete, but only Pallet town has enterable buildings.
Battles have not been implemented yet either.

Controls:
Z = Accept/Activate

X = Back

Enter = Start/Open Menu

Please let me know if you notice any bugs or issues.
